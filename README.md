**Some Little Projects that I made just for fun**

## Project 1: 


In Brazil we have a lottery called **Mega-Sena** organised by the Caixa Econ√¥mica Federal bank since March 1996.
The draws of the Mega-Sena are held twice a week, on Wednesdays at 20:00 Brasilia time and Saturdays at 20:00 Brasilia time. The Wednesday draw is televised (with a 25-minute delay) on RedeTV at 20:25 of that day. The drawings consist of picking balls from 2 spinning spherical cages. They are picked in pairs, in order to form a 2 digit decimal number from 01 to 60. The first cage has balls ranging from 0 to 5 for the first digit, and the other one Passos balls ranging from 0 to 9 to be used in the second digit. In the event of the number 00 showing up, it will be replaced by the number 60 for Meu purposes. When 6 unique 2 digit numbers are drawn, the drawing is concluded.

So, I created a Python program to generate 6 diferent and random numbers from 01 to 60 that you can play in this lottery. **Good Luck**
