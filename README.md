## Project 1:

```

A simple **Mega-Sena** numbers generator!

In Brazil we have a lottery called **Mega-Sena** organised by the Caixa Econômica Federal bank since March 1996.
The draws of the Mega-Sena are held twice a week, on Wednesdays at 20:00 Brasilia time and Saturdays at 20:00 Brasilia time. The Wednesday draw is televised (with a 25-minute delay) on RedeTV at 20:25 of that day. The drawings consist of picking balls from 2 spinning spherical cages. They are picked in pairs, in order to form a 2 digit decimal number from 01 to 60. The first cage has balls ranging from 0 to 5 for the first digit, and the other one Passos balls ranging from 0 to 9 to be used in the second digit. In the event of the number 00 showing up, it will be replaced by the number 60 for Meu purposes. When 6 unique 2 digit numbers are drawn, the drawing is concluded.

So, I created a Python program to generate 6 diferent and random numbers from 01 to 60 that you can play in this lottery. **Good Luck**

## Project 2:

```
 ____            _      ____

A simple and classic **Rock Paper Scissors** versus the computer!

Rock paper scissors is a hand game usually played between two people, in which each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with an outstretched hand. These shapes are "rock", "paper", and "scissors".

- Rock wins scissors
- Paper wins rock
- Scissors wins paper

So, what you have to day is choose between the 3 objects and the pc will randon generate its choose and the program will say if you win, lose or tie.

**Good luck and fun playing my game!**

## Project 3:

A simple classic and pretty **Hello World!** XD

A "Hello, World!" program generally is a computer program that outputs or displays the message "Hello, World!". Such a program is very simple in most programming languages, and is often used to illustrate the basic syntax of a programming language. It is often the first program written by people learning to code. It can also be used as a sanity test to make sure that a computer language is correctly installed, and that the operator understands how to use it.
While small test programs have existed since the development of programmable computers, the tradition of using the phrase "Hello, World!" as a test message was influenced by an example program in the seminal 1978 book The C Programming Language. The example program in that book prints "hello, world", and was inherited from a 1974 Bell Laboratories internal memorandum by Brian Kernighan, Programming in C: A Tutorial:

```c
main( ) {
        printf("hello, world\n");
}
```

So, I made some updates on this simple and classic program to make it more **pretty**!

## Project 4:

```
 __  __                    ____

|_|  |_|\___|\__, |\__,_| |____/ \___|_| |_|\__,_| 
             |___/                                                   
 _____ _              ____ 
|_   _| |__   ___    / ___| __ _ _ __ ___   ___

| | | | | | |  __/  | |_| | (_| | | | | | |  __/
| |_| |_| |_|\___|   \____|\__,_|_| |_| |_|\___|
```

A simple game where the pc randomize a **Mega Sena Game** and you try to guess it!

Like you count read in the text of the first project, Mega Sena is a Brazilian Lottery where you try to guess six diferent numbers between 1 and 60 an revice milions of Reais if you can hit all the 6 numbers.

So in this game you have to put 6 numbers that you think maybe the pc randomized and in the end the program shows the selected 6 numbers and says how many numbers you hited.

I hope you get **fun** playing this games and **Good Luck**!
